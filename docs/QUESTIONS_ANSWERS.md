1. If a book is an object, what is its encapsulated data?

    A1. Objects encapsulated data is basically everything inside the {}. 

    In our case this is the `title`, `author` & `qty`;

2. What data, of a book's encapsulated data, might be changeable?

    A2. We can change/update the values of the properties, delete properties, add and change conditions.

3. Why is representing a book as an object a better idea than representing it as a string?

    A3. Strings are primitive data type, they don't have a structure and are hard to itterate through specially if you don't have strict validation against them. 

    The object model is allowing us to easilly access the data we need by pointing to it's key. Despite the data format we can always easily access it just by pointing at it.
